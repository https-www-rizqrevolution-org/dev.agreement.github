### Spoken Languages
We have just introduced a new Hacker metadata feature that allows hackers to specify their spoken languages to enhance their profile even further!
To try it out, simply visit the Settings page at https://hackerone.com/settings/profile/edit.
We plan to utilize this information to enhance features like Opportunities, allowing us to offer opportunities that align more closely with linguistic expertise; a customer/hacker win-win.

### CVE & CWE Discovery
CVE & CWE Discovery helps you discover trends in common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) and common weakness enumerations (CWEs). By better understanding the vulnerability landscape, hackers can focus their research efforts on existing threats that are still being exploited, while organizations can gain insight into existing threats and harden against new ones.
